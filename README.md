  Tensorflow
  Nltk
  Wordcloud
  Numpy
  Pandas
  Seaborn
  Sklearn
  pickle
  string 
  warnings
Dataset from : https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/tree/master/data
model.h is saved model file
tokenizer.pkl is saved file to convert string to vectors
Model_creation file is used for model creation and model.h5 and tokenizer.pkl are saved after running Model_creation.ipynb file
Input testing file is used for testing input. This file can only be used only when model and tokenizer files are saved.
This is not a machine learning model in the conventional sense but a neural network model for deep learning.
